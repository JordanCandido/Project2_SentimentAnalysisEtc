## (NewsAPI) Crypto/Stock Sentiment Analysis
### Crypto and Stock:
### Use an API that pull tweets from imporant people and on-chain analysis, check if there is a twitter corpus for pulling tweets
### Web scraping twitter for most talked about cryptos, possibly create some sort Hype Index that quantifies the amount of discussion on a specific crypto or stock
#### Certian buzz words such as 'to the moon' may not be used postively in sentiment library
### Use NewsAPI with sources from CNBC, and other credible sources
### Use Coindesk or other crypto API's to pull relevant sentiment information
### Research other API's for websites like Reddit and other key platforms to see which may be used best
